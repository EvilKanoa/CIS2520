Program Description
*******************
This program provides an implementation of a basic hash table as well
as the programs to test the implementation.

***********
Compilation
***********
Use `make` or `make test` to compile the testing program and the hash table API. It will create an executable in the bin/ directory called `test` which can then be ran without any arguments to run unit tests on the API and display the results.

Use `make cppcheck` to run the C style checker over every .c file in the project.

Use `make doxy` to run doxygen based on the Doxyfile and generate documentation for the project.

Use `make clean` to remove all built binary files and remove unnecessary files from the project.

Program Description
*******************
This software implements a balanced binary search tree using the AVL tree design. It allows lookup, insertion, and delation all with complexities of O(log n). It uses the height of a node to aid in rebalancing the tree correctly.

***********
Compilation
***********

Use `make` or `make test` to compile the testing program for the heap library. It will create an executable in the `bin/` directory called `test` which can then be ran without any arguments to run a suite of unit tests for the tree library.

Use `make cppcheck` to run the C style checker over every `.c` file in the project.

Use `make doxy` to run doxygen based on the Doxyfile and generate documentation for the project.

Use `make clean` to remove all built binary files and remove unnecessary files from the project.

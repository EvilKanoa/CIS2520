Program Description

***********
Compilation
***********

Use `make` or `make program` to compile the main program for the POS system. It will create an executable in the `bin/` directory called `program` which can then be ran without any arguments to run the system.

Use `make cppcheck` to run the C style checker over every `.c` file in the project.

Use `make doxy` to run doxygen based on the Doxyfile and generate documentation for the project.

Use `make clean` to remove all built binary files and remove unnecessary files from the project.

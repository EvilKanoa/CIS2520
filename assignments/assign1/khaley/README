Program Description
*******************
Provides a simulation of a four way stop intersection using a queue based ADT.

***********
Compilation
***********
To compile you will need the LinkedList and Queue API headers as well as the
implementations. Then you can compile using fourwaystop.c as the main.

************************************
Known Limitations, Issues and Errors
************************************
- The simulation does not account for cars being able to go at once when in
opposite directions and both going forward.
- The right of way formula is not always correct and sometimes allows cars to
go in an unrealistic order.

**********
Complexity
**********
The Big O notation for each QueueAPI function.
- queueCreate: O(1)
- queueFromList: O(1)
- queueDestroy: O(n)
- enqueue: O(1)
- dequeue: O(1)
- queuePeak: O(1)
- queueLength: O(n)
